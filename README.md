# Vigilant


Vigilant is minimalistic framework for functional/regression testing without bloated dependencies.

It was build on top of `php-webdriver` and `phpunit` following KISS principle.

`phpunit` - is the only testing framework you need. **Vigilant** just provide additional methods to help you with functional testing.
You still have all features which `phpunit` has (create new extensions, write hooks, implement listeners, etc.)
but with additional assertions (see, dontSee, seeCookie, etc.) and methods for interacting with web page (click, fillField,
scrollTo, etc.,).
